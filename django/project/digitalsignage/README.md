# To Do
1) Check state-of-the-art on face recognition (the one used is from 2017) and replace it if needed.
2) Depending on the position of the camera, a mere face rotation estimation might be enough to check if someone is looking to the screen, instead of the reference point + head pose (gaze estimation might also be an option).
3) Time in scene is missing.
4) Replace the Dlib face detector with the output of raspberry (bounding boxes + facial landmarks).
